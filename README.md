# Aim -: 
The aim of this practical is to understand and implement the process of copying data from one file to another using the fs (file system) module in Node.js.

# Task to be done:
Step 1: Open File that stores output of Experiment 1 using Notepad Using Notepad abcd.txt

Step 2: Create a New File name newabcd.js (keep it empty) using Notepad Using Notepad newabcd.txt

Step 3: Create a New File name Transferdata.js .This file will contain the code to transfer data from abcd.txt to newabcd.txt

Step 4: Write the Program to Copy Data in Transferdata.js Step 5: Run the Program using node transferdata.js

# Learning outcomes (What I have learnt):
1. Understanding File Streams: Understood the concept of file streams and their significance in efficiently handling large data transfers.

2. Using the fs Module: Demonstrated the ability to use the fs module's createReadStream() and createWriteStream() functions to interact with files for reading and writing operations.

3. Implementing Data Copying: Wrote code to effectively copy the data from a source file to a destination file using stream pipes and asynchronous programming techniques.

4. Troubleshooting Errors: Diagnosed and troubleshooted common errors that may occur during file operations, and applied appropriate error-handling strategies.
